realtime nine
realtime nine - At this point, all realtime quantums have been demoted to interactive.
    Nine real time processes, 6 quantums each(ctrl + f for a realtime process nine and count quantums to see this), so 54 realtime processes have run total
    At this point, 20 interactive quantums have run, the two sets of interactive nine(9 each) + interactive one and two = 20
    6 Background processes have run. 
    Total quantums run = 80 in total
    Real Time: 54/80 = about .675 
    Interactive: 20/80 = about .2 
    Background: 6/80 = .075 or about .1
